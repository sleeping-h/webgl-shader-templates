# webgl-shader-templates

This repository contains standalone HTML files with full-screen animated shaders implemented using GLSL and WebGL. These templates are perfect for local development and experiments, also good for educational purposes.

To keep these templates both valuable and easy to read, I include some useful features like screen aspect ratio and pixel density, but skip some details like cross-platform rendering, generating resolution-agnostic picture, keyboard controls, etc. 

## Contents
### vertex-galaxy.html

A template with an animated particle system implemented using a vertex shader. It uses two input buffers with initial parameters and draws approximately 1,000,000 points in a spiral galaxy pattern.

### 2d-sdf-fragment.html
Animated fragment shader made with GLSL ES 3.00 and webgl2. 2D SDF demo

## TODO

add examples:
- audio-reactive
- webcam channel
- interacting particles

add pause/resume event

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! :) If you know how to improve the templates or noticed some bugs, I'll be happy to accept your PR
